# *.olinclubs.com template

This is a template website for making your own Club page on [olinclubs.com](http://olinclubs.com/)! Steps to get started with this template:

1. Go to your terminal (Linux/OS X preferred).
1. Type `git clone https://github.com/tcr/club-site-template.git mycoolclubwebsite` to download the template into a new folder, `mycoolclubwebsite`.
1. Start editing pages! `index.html` is the root of your website. Add more pages to suit your club. The `contact` folder is an example provided for you.
1. To test out what your site looks like, inside `mycoolclubwebsite/`, type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. Go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) in your web browser and your page should be visible.
1. Bootstrap, a theme which includes many nice features, is included on every page. Check out [http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) to learn about what you can do with it.
1. Edit `script.js` to add custom JavaScript, or `style.css` for custom CSS. [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is already included on every page.
